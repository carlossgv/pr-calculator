# Plate visuals

## Where
- Detail modal on percent cards.

## Visual rules
- KG colors: 25 red, 20 blue, 15 yellow, 10 green, 5 white, 2.5 red, 2 blue, 1.5 yellow, 1 black, 0.5 blue.
- KG diameters: 25/20/15/10 same; 5 smaller; 2.5/2/1.5 same; 1 medium; 0.5 small.
- LB diameter: constant across all lb plates.
- Plate thickness: scales with plate value (both kg and lb).

## Notes
- Plate sizes are grouped to reflect real equipment rather than proportionally scaled weights.
- The bar shaft is intentionally short so the plates read as the focus.
